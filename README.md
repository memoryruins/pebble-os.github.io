# Website for Pebble OS
This is the code for [Pebble OS's website](https://pebble-os.github.io). It serves as a central place for documentation and links to source code, as well as updates and information about releases.
At the moment, it is literally some HTML and CSS I threw together (and I'm by no means a webdev), so feedback and PRs are more than welcome!
